% x: xyz coordinates of protein
% torsional: a n-by-4 matrix with each row of 4 ints representing 0-based indices of the four atoms that have torsional or improper interactions. 
% kphi: the spring constant of each torsional/improper interaction.
% hessian:  hessian matrix due to torsional/improper interactions.
%
% Note: all eq. numbers are from the reference. 
% Note: at present, we are NOT consider d2theta/dr2 term but only outer product of (dphi/dr) with itself. The derivation of d2theta/dr2 term is included before but commented out. Its correctness has NOT been checked.
