% x: xyz coordinates of protein
% angles: a n-by-3 matrix with each row of 3 ints representing 0-based indices of the three atoms that have bond angle interactions. 
% ktheta: the spring constant of each interaction.
% hessian:  hessian matrix due to bond angle interactions.

% Note: at present, we are NOT consider d2theta/dr2 term but only outer product of (dtheta/dr) with itself.
