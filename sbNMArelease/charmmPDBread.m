function [xyz]=charmmPDBread(charmmPDBfilename)
% Read a charmm pdb file and saved the results into the following array:
% xyz: a N by 7 arrays, where N is the number of atoms, whose columns are: 
% column 1: atom sequence number (1 to N)
% column 2: residue number
% column 3-5: coordinates
% column 6 (char): atom types, e.g., 'C', 'N', 'O', 'H', 'S'.  
% column 7 (char): backbone atoms, 'A' for C_alpha, 'N' for N, 'C' for C, 'O' for O, 0 for everything else.
